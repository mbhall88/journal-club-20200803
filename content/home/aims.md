# Aim

**Characterise the drivers of *in vivo* *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* mutagenesis**

---

# Why?

Mutation is the sole driver of antobiotic resistance in *Mtb*.  

{{% fragment %}}So, any insights into how mutations arise will naturally lead to a better understanding of resistance.{{% /fragment %}}

## State of knowlegde

- Little is known about the in-host drivers of mutation
- {{% fragment %}} Host immune system **postulated** to drive *Mtb* towards non-replicating state{{% /fragment %}}
- {{% fragment %}} Evidence in macaques that mutation rate equivalent in active and latent disease{{% /fragment %}}
- {{% fragment %}} Most WGS work has focused on how resistance mutations become fixed during treatment{{% /fragment %}}
- {{% fragment %}} During active TB, estimated $10^{10}$ - $10^{12}$ bacilli{{% /fragment %}}
