## Conclusions

> The pairwise SNP distance between any two colonies within a host could occasionally exceed the SNP thresholds used to define a transmission cluster

---

## Conclusions

> The elevated mutation rate in some colonies carries the signature of ROS-mediated mutagenesis

{{% fragment %}}The authors suggest that increased ROS-induced mutations could *"explain the high rate of acquired resistance during clinical treatment"*{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}Could be interesting to see how many of these oxidative substitutions there are in `mykrobe` panel{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Conclusions

ROS heterogeneity could be a by-product of granuloma heterogeneity

{{% fragment %}}From the data presented, this seems very likely. HIV-positive patients had much lower C>T mutations, clearly indicating host immune response plays a role in oxidative mutagenesis{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Conclusions

Findings give support to the hypothesis that only one or a few granulomas, which can no longer contain the *Mtb*, are responsible for the onset of active disease.

{{% fragment %}}Suggests "turning point" theory in which the deterioration of a particular lesion leads to clinical disease.{{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}}Biomarkers that can predict such a transition would allow preventative interventions.{{% /fragment %}}

## Conclusions

SNP thresholds, on the whole, are good approximations, but occasional outliers need to be kept in mind and included when conducting epidemiological investigation

---

## Caveats

Cannot completely rule out increased bacterial susceptibility to ROS.

Whilst this trait is not inherited in these samples, it is possible the four strains only recently acquired such a "ROS susceptibility"

---

## Caveats

- Frequencies of SNPs in whole colonies in Figure 1B might not be very reflective as there are only 9 
- Only compared mutation rate to simulated data for the four samples
- Not clear how the C>T analysis was done
